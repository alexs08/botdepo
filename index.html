        <h2>Help</h2>
        <h4>How do I stop Cringo Memaz from reacting to messages in certain channels?</h4>
        <p>Disable his permissions to send messages in the channels you don't want him to send them in. If you still want filtering, DO NOT disable reading and managing messages. Make sure he doesn't have Administrator permissions.</p>
        <h4>I have kick and ban permissions, but SDUB forbids me from using the ban and kick commands!</h4>
        <p>Check to make sure the bot is online. If he is online, contact me at entertainmentnetworkrebirth@gmail.com. Also check to make sure his Administrator permissions are enabled.</p>
        <h4>Why can't I add any of your bots?</h4>
        <p>Get off of Internet Explorer. This is likely a problem with your browser or Discord.</p>
        <h4>How do I change Cringo Memaz's filters?</h4>
        <p>You can't.</p>
        <h4>Why won't Pressure display weather for my area?</h4>
            <p>You need to contact me at entertainmentnetworkrebirth@gmail.com</p>
